    <h3>   In this project, we created an imaginary world for the user to design. We allowed 
	   the user to input several different colors for the objects displayed. 
	   The user could pick the color of the house: its windows, roof and door, 
	   they couldpick the color of the garden: flowers, ladybug wings, and the spider. 
	   In addition to the colors, we allowed the user to pick what they 
	   would like to move in the image: a hot air balloon, a plane, or a bee
	   in the garden. </h3>

    <h3>   For the second project, we created a game where the objective is to fly towards a gas pump. First, 
	    we imported random, turtle, and randint to begin. After that, we created the variables that would hold the 
	    timer, plane image, and gas image. Afterward, we added the background which would 
	    resemble a bright and blue sky for the plane to fly around in. After initializing the 
	    gas pump, the timer, and the plane, we then created the game functions which would house the 
	    key components of our game; these functions were drawing the gas pump and the plane. “Refilling” the 
	    gasoline, or changing its location once it collided with the plane. The movements of both the plane and gas pump. 
	    The score counter which holds how many points the player has. Finally, the timer which would indicate how much 
	    time the player had before the turtle would hide. Once we created all the proper game functions, we then 
	    added a death screen to indicate when the player had run out of time or when the player had crashed into a bird. 
	    If the plane reaches the gas pump in time, then the game would restart, and the player gains a point.
